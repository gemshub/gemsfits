Build gfshell2 and gemsfit2 on Qt 5.3.2 for Windows.

1. To be able to build gemsfit2 code for parallel processing copy the file 
pthreadGC2.dll from the gemsfit2_dlls/OMP foldder into your Windows\System32\ 
folder. By doing this there should be no warnings on the lines where "#pragma 
omp parallel for" is present in the code. If a warning is present the program 
will build OK, but the parallelization option will not work.

2. Open the *-win.pro files in Qt under Windows and build. 


Running gemsfit2 from gfshell2 or gemsfit2 from gfshell2 outside Qt-Creator.

1. Copy the *.dll files from their respective folders to the place were the 
executable files of the programs were compiled. For example copy all the dll 
files from the gemsfit2_dlls to gemsfit2_build folder of the Qt project. 
Otherwise gemsfit2 code will not run when accessed by the gf2shell. 

This will also allow running gfshell2 and gemsfit2 outside the Qt environment, 
just by executing the exe files from Windows Explorer or Command Promt.
