HOW TO PRODUCE AN INSTALLATION PACKAGE OF Qt5-based GEMSFITS FOR LINUX
(Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04 LTS)

This deployment process is based on the "gemsfit2deployqtapp.sh" script,
which is an augmented and extended "deployqtapp.sh" script from
https://github.com/goblincoding/qtscripts by goblincoding, see also
http://goblincoding.com/2013/11/07/deploying-qt-5-applications-on-ubuntu-12-04/  

1. Make sure that Qt5 SDK is installed with source code as /Qt in 
your home directory; we assume that the Qt library is located as 
"/home/you/Qt/5.2.1/src" and "/home/you/Qt/5.2.1/gcc_64" (or gcc_32).

2. Create a /GEMSFITSDEPLOY folder with subfolder /gemsfits-app. 
Copy the /Resources and /Tests folders into /GEMSFITSDEPLOY folder. Copy
the files  gemsfits.png, Readme.Run.Linux.txt, and rungemsfits.sh from
/Docs/DeployLinux to /GEMSFITSDEPLOY/gemsfits-app

9. Make an installer archive from the contents of GEMSFITSDEPLOY/ folder:

   $ cd ~
   $ tar cvzf GEMSFITS.1-<rev1>.<rev2>-linux-x86-64.tgz GEMSFITSDEPLOY

for instance: 
   $ tar cvzf GEMSFITS.1-592.1036-linux-x86-64.tgz GEMSFITSDEPLOY

Test on a Linux system without any of the dependencies installed.
