HOW TO PRODUCE AN INSTALLATION PACKAGE OF Qt5-based GEMSFITS FOR Win32 MinGW 4.8 
(Windows XP, 7 or 8; admininstrator rights for your account are needed)

This deployment process is based on the "windeployqt.exe" utility,
which is an augmented "windeployqt.exe" binary by lkc, taken from
https://github.com/lkc/windeployqt.

1. Make sure that the Qt5 SDK is installed as C:\Qt or in similar folder.
We assume that the Qt library is located in C:\Qt\5.3\mingw482_32\bin
and Qt Tools are located in C:\Qt\Tools\mingw482_32\bin (or similar, 
depending on the current Qt version, MinGW version and their locations).  

2. Create a C:\GEMSFITSDEPLOY folder with subfloder \gemsfits-app. 
Copy the \Resources and \Tests folders into C:\GEMSFITSDEPLOY folder, 
as well as "GEMSFITS.lnk" file. 
 
3. Into the C:\GEMSFITSDEPLOY\gemsfits-app folder, copy files "runwindeployqt.bat" 
and "windeployqt.exe", and then edit the "runwindeployqt.bat" file to make sure 
that it contains the correct paths to C:\Qt\5.3\mingw482_32\bin and 
to C:\Qt\Tools\mingw482_32\bin folders (modify to actual ones, if necessary). 
Copy (or refresh) the files "qcollectiongenerator.exe", "qhelpconverter.exe" 
and "qhelpgenerator.exe" from C:\Qt\5.3\mingw482_32\bin to 
C:\GEMSFITSDEPLOY\gemsfits-app folder.   

4. Using QtCreator (Qt 5.3 MinGW 4.8.2 32bit), build the actual release 
variant of gemsfits.exe (gfshell2) using the *_win.pro Qt project file. 
Find gemsfits.exe in the \gfhell2-build folder and copy it into the 
C:\GEMSFITSDEPLOY\gemsfits-app folder.    

5. In a command-line prompt window (terminal), cd to 
C:\GEMSFITSDEPLOY\gemsfits-app and run the command:

	>runwindeployqt.bat gemsfits.exe

This will find and copy all Qt dependence files (Qt libraries, plugins, runtime 
MinGW libraries, locale files, etc.) into C:\GEMSFITSDEPLOY\gemsfits-app folder.
Copy all the rest of the dependencies, *.dll files (for both gfschell2.exe and 
gemsfit2.exe programs), from \Docs\BuildRun_win32\gemsfits_dlls to 
C:\GEMSFITSDEPLOY\gemsfits-app folder.

6. To test that Gfshell2 GUI runs, cd to \gemsfits-app and run gemsfits.exe.

7. Using QtCreator (Qt 5.3 MinGW 4.8.2 32bit), build the actual release 
variant of gemsfit2.exe (gemsfit2) using the *_win.pro Qt project file (see
BuildRun_win32.txt). Find gemsfit2.exe in the \gemsfit2-build folder and copy 
it into C:\GEMSFITSDEPLOY\gemsfits-app folder.

9. To test that gemsfit2.exe works correctly, first start gemsfits.exe, 
open a test project, check if the path to the gemsfits2.exe is correctly 
defined in the "Help" "Preferences...", and start a fitting task. You can 
either browse to the absolute path, or (preferable) enter a relative path:
"./gemsfit2".  

7. To create a new GEMSFITS installer file for Windows 7 or Windows 8:

If not yet done, download and install 7-zip v.9.20 (http://www.7-zip.org/). 
Start it and select the C:\GEMSFITSDEPLOY folder. Add it contents (i.e. 
\gemsfits-app folders and a few files) recursively to the archive (to be 
created e.g. in C:\TEMP folder) "C:\TEMP\GEMSFITSDEPLOY.7z". 

If not yet done, download and install 7zip-sfx-maker v.3.3 utility from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sfx-maker/ . Also download ResourceHacker 
v.3.6 from http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/; install it into 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\7-Zip SFX Maker\Resource Hacker" folder. 
Once you have to copy the GEMSFITS.ico file into the \Resources folder of the
folder where the 7zip-sfx-maker program is installed.  

Start the 7zip-sfx-maker as administrator and click on "Load Settings..." 
button. Select the file .\Docs\DeployWindows\Self-extractor-GEMSFITS-settings.xml 
Then, using "+" button or "Files" "Add 7z file...", select the 
file "C:\TEMP\GEMSFITSDEPLOY.7z" prepared previously. Click through tabs 
"Dialogs", "Icon", "Tasks", "Metadata" and edit what is necessary, e.g. revision
and version numbers, date of production, etc. When done, click on "Save 
settings..." button to save settings to the file
 .\Docs\win-build-release\Self-extractor-GEMSFITS-settings.xml
which is under version control. Then click on the "Make SFX" button to 
create the self-installer file. This will create a file 
C:\TEMP\GEMSFITSDEPLOY.sfx.exe. Rename it according to the following pattern:

	C:\TEMP\GEMSFITS.1-<rev1>.<rev2>-win32-install.sfx.exe 

where put the same actual revision numbers for GEMSFITS (rev1) and 
GEMS3K (rev2) parts, as used in "Self-extractor-GEMSFITS-settings.xml" 
file. The self-extracting installer can now be distributed. 

Note that before updating/re-installing GEMSFITS to the same location, 
the user will have to backup all your project subfolders in the "Tests" 
folder because they will be overwritten with those in the installer having 
identical names.
