    <h2>Terms and Conditions of Use</h2>
    <hr>The GEMSFITS Software and related material (data and documentation),
    contained in or furnished in connection with the GEM-Selektor v.3 (GEMS3)
    program package for geochemical modelling, are made available by the Paul
    Scherrer Institute (PSI) &amp; ETH Zrich to be used in the public interest
    and for the advancement of science.
    <p>Permission to use the GEM Software is thereby granted free of charge for
      educational and academic research purposes only, provided and as long as
      these Terms and Conditions of Use are accepted. </p>
    <p> The user agrees to acknowledge the authors in any publications and
