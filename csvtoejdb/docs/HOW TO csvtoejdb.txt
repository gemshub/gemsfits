csvtoejdb uses boost and jansson external libraries and EJDB coupled libary

1. Have your data in a preformated exceel file - see excel_example.xls as a template.
2. Save your file as comma separated format "," (as separator) CSV.
3. Run the program csvtoejdb with arguments as in the example: "-run CASH/ solcash CASH.csv" where:
	first argument is the path to the CSV and database files, 2nd argument is the name of the database, and 3rd argument is the input CSV file
4. The program is default set to create a new database every time is executed - no appending of data.
	If you have acces to the C++ project on line 44 in main.cpp remove argument "JBOTRUNC", resulting in appending of data to the database.

5. Structure of the excel file:

sample - name of sample - SHOULD BE UNIQUE
expdataset - name of experimental dataset
	Only unique pairs are allowed. The program checks for unique sample and expdataset pairs; if pairs with the same names are added, the program should give an error and not execute.

sT, sP - temperature and pressure

!!! error THEN unit - should always come in this order after the value of interest!!! They can be omitted or cells left unfilled.

comp. - keyword that describes the composition of the experiment. comp. should be followed by an oxide eg. comp.SiO2

phase. - keyword that describes a phase. After phase. comes the name of the phase (as in GEMS) eg. phase.aq_gen., followed by the property of the phase eg. phase.aq_gen.pH, component of the phase
eg. phase.aq_gen.Si, or dependent component/species of a phase which is marked by "Dc" after the dot(.) eg. phase.aq_gen.DcSiO2-. For dependent components, different properties can follow, such as quantity .dQnt, .@coef, etc. (eg. phase.aq_gen.DcSiO2-.@coef for activity coefficient of SiO2-).

!!! Names of phases, components, elements should be the same as in GEMS3K exported files !!!
