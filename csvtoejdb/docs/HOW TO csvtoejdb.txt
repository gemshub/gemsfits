1. Have your data in a preformated exceel file - see CASH.xls as a template.
2. Save your file as coma separated format "," (as separator) CSV.
3. Run the program csvtoejdb with arguments as in the example: "CASH/ solcash CASH.csv" where:
	first argument is the path to the CSV and database files, 2nd argument is the name of the database, and 3rd argument is the CSV file
4. The program is default set to create a new database every time is executed - no appending of data.
	If you have acces to the C++ project on line 44 remove argument "JBOTRUNC", resulting in appending of data to the database.

5. Structure of the excel file:

sample - name of sample - SHOULD BE UNIQUE
expdataset - name of experimental dataset
sT, sP - temperature and pressure
!!! error and unit - should alsways come in this order after the value of interest!!!
comp. - keyword that describes the composition of the experiment. comp. should be followed by an oxide eg. comp.SiO2
phase. - keyword that describes a pahse. After pahse. comes the name of the pahse (as in GEMS) eg. pahse.aq_gen., followed by the property of the pahse eg. pahse.aq_gen.pH, component of the pahse
eg. pahse.aq_gen.Si, or dependent component/species of a phase which is marked by "s" after the dot(.) eg. phase.aq_gen.sSiO2-
!!! Names of the pahse, components, elements should be the same as in GEMS3K exported files !!!
