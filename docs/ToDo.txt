+ completed or partially completed
- to be completed

+ Printing class - printing in /results/FIT_results.csv
- test inverse weighting more
- solidsolution composition
+ test the reaction constraint - also test if logk is respected at higher temperatures
- test interaction parameters
- problems with GEMS convergence - can affect the ocnvergence as BOBYQA - decides how to change paramters ased on first residuals

- type of data to compare (molality and log molality) etc...

- look over the statistics
