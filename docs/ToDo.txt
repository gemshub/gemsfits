+ completed or partially completed
- to be completed

+ Printing class - printing in /results/FIT_results.csv
- test inverse weighting more
- solidsolution composition
+ test the reaction constraint 
- also test if logk is respected at higher temperatures
- test interaction parameters

- problems with GEMS convergence - can affect the convergence as BOBYQA - decides how to change parameters based on first residuals

- type of data to compare (molality and log molality) etc...
+ added phase amount, phase vlolume, dcomp amount, dcomp activity coeficient
- not added Eh, osmotic coeficient.
- think about units, how to make a uniform strategy for units.

+ add bulk composition as parameters 
+ work on L (linked) type parameters  

+ look over the statistics !! think about the weighting matrix problem in the Var/Cov calculation.


+ make a separate RUN function in TGfittask so one can access the data manager and calculate statistics before the fitting procedure.
