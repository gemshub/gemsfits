Data Source - EJDB database

Data Select - The user can select individual experiments, datasets, and temperature and pressure intervals.

Data Exclude - Not implemented yet! - For now one can exclude by not selecting :)

Type of target functions - least square: (computed - measured)^2; 

Weighting - inverr: 1/error; inverr2: 1/error^2; inverr3: 1/measured^2;

Data To Compare - (only aqueous July 2013) phase chemical (elements) composition, given in molal or loga (meaning log) units;
		  phase properties: pH, amount, volume in -loga (meaning -log) or molal, g or kg, cm3 or m3;
		  phase dependent components: amount (in mole amount), activity coeficient 

Parameters to fit - G0 (Gibbs free energy at 25 C and 1 bar), bIC (bulk composition), PMc (interaction parameter coefficients for non-ideal solutions)
		    G0, bIC, and PMc can be marked with F followed by the initial value or a JSON type with initial, upper and lower bounds specified
		    G0 can also be marked by R - as reaction dependent (using the reaction constant)
		    bIC can also be marked by L - as linked parameters e.g if we have Na linked with Cl and we add 1 mole of Cl, 1 mole of Na will be automatically added
