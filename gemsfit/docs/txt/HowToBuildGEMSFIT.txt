1. Checkout svn+ssh://<user>@savannah01.psi.ch/repos/gems/GEMSFIT/kernel/trunk to /home/<user>/Developer/GEMSFIT

2. In ubuntu: in Program Center, search for psql and install libqt4-sql-psql  and postgresql-client.
   search for libecpg and install packages libecpg6 and libecpg-dev.
   search for libboost and istall libboost-all-dev.
   search for liblapack and install liblapack3gf and liblapack-dev.
   check if libblas and install are installed by liblapack installer, if needed, install libblas3gf and libblas-dev.
   search for libmotif and install libmotif4 and libmotif-dev.

3. Go to http://arma.sourceforge.net and download Armadillo C++ library stable version armadillo-2.4.2.tar.gz.
   Unpack it, change into the directory that was created by unpacking the armadillo archive, and type the following
  commands:
  
  cmake .
  make 
  sudo make install

4. Go to http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt#Download_and_installation and download nlopt-2.2.4.tar.gz
   Unpack it, go into the nlopt directory and execute
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

5. Go to http://www.mps.mpg.de/dislin/linux.html and download DISLIN distribution i586_64 for ubuntu >= 7.04 
   unpack archive dislin-10.2.linux.i586_64.tar.gz
   in /home/<user>/.bashrc, add lines at the end:

   DISLIN=~/bin/dislin
   export DISLIN
   PATH=${PATH}:${DISLIN}/bin
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DISLIN:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   save and execute the commands
   source /home/parallels/.bashrc
   ./INSTALL

6. Check in the GEMSFIT.pro that links to postgresql and dislin libraries are correct (change if necessary). 
   locate ecpglib.h in the system and check in the GEMSFIT.pro that the correct link is provided. 

7. To build GEMSFIT, execute
   qmake "CONFIG += serial release" GEMSFIT.pro
   make
   
It is possible to use debug instead of release key, and mpi instead of serial (then openmpi libraries must be istalled first). 
To run GEMSFIT, cd into trunk/GEMSFIT/target_GEMSFIT and run ./gemsfit
