Issues for Svitlana (bugs or extension ideas for mid-2015)

- bug: devGFshell branch: windows only: Upon opening a fitting project, GEMS3K files are not opened (error message), seems to be a problem with file path or the CR/LF format
- gfshell2: DB size issue: To cut gemsfit2 log file when adding it to task results database record (only header and end messages). Critical for win32 (max 2 GB database size).
- gfshell2: bug: upon scrolling any record in database or task mode or clicking on the editor field (without editing anything), when another record is selected,
   the "Data record has been changed" appears. This should be fixed - otherwise it is misleading for users and has a risk of data corruption. Could be result of Qt5 update.
